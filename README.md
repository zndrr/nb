# nb (aka Netbox)

#### Welcome traveller

This repo is a hobby effort to do stuff to make Netbox easier.
I am lazy, so I contradict myself with effort to be lazy?

I am in no way affiliated with the wonderful project maintainers; just a fan of the tool!

Not much going on yet. Should expand as stuff is added.

For now, there is a set of bash scripts to help with Netbox install. Ongoing effort.


Enjoy,
Zndrr
